{"name":"curlhs","tagline":"Haskell bindings to curl library (libcurl)","body":"# Network.CURL\r\n\r\n[*curlhs*][curlhs.htm] is a Haskell package that provides a Haskell\r\ninterface to [*libcurl*][libcurl.htm], the multiprotocol file transfer\r\nlibrary. And *libcurl* ...\r\n\r\n> *libcurl* is most probably the most portable, most powerful\r\n> and most often used C-based multi-platform file transfer\r\n> library on this planet - be it open source or commercial.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n[*curlhs*][curlhs.htm] is written in the [Haskell][haskell.htm]\r\nprogramming language and requires the Haskell compiler [GHC][ghc.htm]\r\nand the Haskell's package manager [Cabal][cabal.htm] to build and install.\r\nThe easiest way to get them is with a binary installer of the\r\n[Haskell Platform][platform.htm].\r\n\r\nIf you have the right setup, then getting *curlhs*\r\nshould be as simple as running two commands:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cabal update\r\n$ cabal install curlhs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will download and install the latest *curlhs*\r\npackage from [Hackage][hackage.htm].\r\n\r\nYou don't need [*libcurl*][libcurl.htm] to install [*curlhs*][curlhs.htm],\r\nand you don't need it also to build programs that use *curlhs*. But you need\r\nto have an appropriate version of *libcurl* in scope to execute those programs\r\nlater. The [dynamic loading] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_loading)\r\nmechanisms are used behind the scenes to link/load *libcurl* at runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nAs usual for Haskell packages, the first place to search for documentation\r\nis [Hackage][hackage.htm]. More docs, like examples and tutorials,\r\nmay be found directly on [GitHub][github.htm] project page.\r\nStart with README.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the main [*libcurl*][libcurl.htm] website contains a vast\r\namount of documentation and other resources. It is highly recommended\r\nto be familiar with those materials to use *curlhs*.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\n```hs\r\nghci> :m Network.CURL720\r\nghci> loadlib CURL720\r\nghci> curl_version\r\n\"libcurl/7.37.1 OpenSSL/1.0.1e zlib/1.2.8\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n*curlhs* must be explicitly linked with *libcurl* at runtime. `loadlib CURL720`\r\nin the example above first tries to load *libcurl* binary image into memory,\r\nthan checks its version (in this case it must be libcurl/7.20 or higher).\r\nLoader looks for *libcurl.so* on UNIX-like systems, *libcurl.dll* on Windows\r\nand *libcurl.dylib* on OS X respectively.
