# Documentation

This is the documentation section of the [*curlhs*][hackage.htm] package.
There is not much here right now, but this should change over time.

Please check out the short [tutorial](tutorial.md) about installation
and basic usage of *curlhs* and *libcurl*.


# Examples

### simple HTTP

[Simple.hs](examples/Simple.hs)
shows how to get a remote web page in only four libcurl function calls.

### simple HTTPS

[Https.hs](examples/Https.hs)
gets a single HTTPS page.
